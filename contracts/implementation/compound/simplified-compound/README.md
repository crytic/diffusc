# Simplified Compound Contracts

The contracts in this directory are reduced versions of the Compound protocol contracts found in [`../compound-0.8.10`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/tree/main/contracts/test/compound/compound-0.8.10). The core contracts, prefixed with `Simple`, have had some functionality removed to simplify evaluation and testing, with the Comp token distribution bug in mind.

## Core Contracts
------------
### __SimpleComptrollerV1__
- The main brains of the protocol, before the upgrade that introduces the bug. Stores the state of all active markets, reward distribution rates and all liquidity providers for each market. 
  - New markets can be added by the admin with [`_supportMarket(CToken cToken)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L333), which in turn calls [`_addMarketInternal(address cToken)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L357). 
  - The admin can set the rate at which suppliers are rewarded with [`_setCompSpeed(CToken cToken, uint compSpeed)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L505). 
  - Suppliers can claim their Comp rewards for all markets by calling [`claimComp()`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L463), which calls `updateCompSupplyIndex(address cToken)` and `distributeSupplierComp(address cToken, address supplier)` for each market in `allMarkets`, followed by a call to `grantCompInternal(address user, address amount)`.
    - [`updateCompSupplyIndex(address cToken)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L421) updates the state of the market, determining the amount of Comp accrued to the market based on the Comp speed and the time that has passed since the last update.
    - [`distributeSupplierComp(address cToken, address supplier)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L442) determines how much Comp an individual supplier has accrued for a market, based on the total Comp accrued to the market itself and the proportion of the market's CTokens held by the supplier.
    - [`grantCompInternal(address user, address amount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L480) transfers Comp tokens from the Comptroller to the user, in the amount of `compAccrued[user]`.
  - Borrowing functionality has been removed, as have functions related to liquidating or seizing borrow positions, as these functions are all essentially more complicated versions of the supply logic, i.e., `distributeBorrowerComp` was very similar to `distributeSupplierComp`.
  - During an upgrade, the admin must call [`_become(Unitroller unitroller)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV1.sol#L364), which calls `unitroller._acceptImplementation()`.

### __SimpleComptrollerV2__
- The upgraded brains of the protocol, based on the upgrade that introduces the token distribution bug.
  - In addition to `_addMarketInternal(address cToken)`, the [`_supportMarket(CToken cToken)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV2.sol#L333) function also calls a new internal function, [`_initializeMarket(address cToken)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV2.sol#L365).
    - If the market has not yet accrued any Comp rewards, `_initializeMarket` will set the index to `compSupplyState[cToken].index = compInitialIndex = 1e36`.
  - In addition to `unitroller._acceptImplementation()`, the [`_become(Unitroller unitroller)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV2.sol#L390) function also calls [`_upgradeSplitCompRewards()`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV2.sol#L397).
    - This function was added because the original upgraded Comptroller switched from a single Comp speed per market to two speeds, one for suppliers and one for borrowers (this has been left out of the simplified contract).
    - Besides setting `compBorrowSpeeds` and `compSupplySpeeds` (commented out here), this function does the same thing as `_initializeMarket` for every market in `allMarkets`, setting `compSupplyState[cToken].index = 1e36` if `compSupplyState[cToken].index == 0`.
  - [`distributeSupplierComp(address cToken, address supplier)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleComptrollerV2.sol#L499) has roughly the same logic as before, but because of the new market initialization, it does not behave as expected when `compSupplierIndex[cToken][supplier] == 0` and `compSupplyState[cToken].index == compInitialIndex`.
    - The condition `if (supplierIndex == 0 && supplyIndex > compInitialIndex)`, which is meant to cover the case where users supplied tokens before the market's supply state was set, evaluates to false, so the line that sets `supplierIndex = compInitialIndex` is not reached (it should have been `supplyIndex >= compInitialIndex`).
    - The amount of Comp distributed is based on the delta between `supplyIndex` and `supplierIndex`, which would be 0 if the condition above evaluated to true, but turns out to be `1e36` due to the market initialization. Therefore far too much Comp is accrued to the user when they call `claimComp()`.

### __SimpleUnitroller__
- The proxy contract for the Comptroller. 
  - To upgrade, the admin must call [`_setPendingImplementation(address newPendingImplementation)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleUnitroller.sol#L38) before calling `Comptroller._become(Unitroller unitroller)`.
  - [`_acceptImplementation()`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleUnitroller.sol#L58) can only be called by the new Comptroller contract in response to a call to `_become`.

### __SimpleCToken__
- The base contract for a Compound market token. Real-world cTokens are either `CErc20`s representing an underlying ERC20 token or `CEther`, the market for ETH. Stores the cToken balance per user, an exchange rate for the underlying asset, an interest rate model and a pointer to the Unitroller.
  - Has the typical token `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance` and `balanceOf`.
  - [`accrueInterest()`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L376) calculates interest accrued since the last checkpointed block.
  - Internal functions [`mintInternal(uint mintAmount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L435) for minting cTokens, [`redeemInternal(uint redeemTokens)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L505) and [`redeemUnderlyingInternal(uint redeemAmount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L516) for redeeming them for underlying tokens, both accrue interest before calling `mintFresh` and `redeemFresh`.
    - [`mintFresh(address minter, uint mintAmount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L447) calls `Comptroller.mintAllowed`, which in turn calls `updateCompSupplyIndex` and `distributeSupplierComp`, and then calls `doTransferIn` which is implemented in the `CErc20` sub-class.
    - [`redeemFresh(address payable redeemer, uint redeemTokensIn, uint redeemAmountIn)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCToken.sol#L529) calls `Comptroller.redeemAllowed`, which in turn calls `updateCompSupplyIndex` and `distributeSupplierComp`, and then calls `doTransferOut` which is implemented in the `CErc20` sub-class.
  - `borrowInternal`, `repayBorrowInternal`, `liquidateBorrowInternal` and `seize` have been removed.

### __SimpleCErc20__
- Inherits `SimpleCToken`, stores the address of the underlying token, implements external `mint` and `redeem` functions as well as internal `doTransferIn` and `doTransferOut`.
  - [`mint(uint mintAmount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCErc20.sol#L48) calls `mintInternal`, [`redeem(uint redeemTokens)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCErc20.sol#L59) and [`redeemUnderlying(uint redeemAmount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCErc20.sol#L70) call `redeemInternal` and `redeemUnderlyingInternal` respectively.
  - [`doTransferIn(address from, uint amount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCErc20.sol#L96) calls `underlying.transferFrom(from, address(this), amount)`.
  - [`doTransferOut(address payable to, uint amount)`](https://github.com/webthethird/solidity-diff-fuzz-upgrades/blob/main/contracts/test/compound/simplified-compound/SimpleCErc20.sol#L133) calls `underlying.transfer(to, amount)`.
  - `borrow`, `repayBorrow`, `repayBorrowBehalf`, `liquidateBorrow` and `sweepToken` have been removed.

### __SimpleComp__
- Really just a typical token, since all governance related functionality has been removed.
  - The Unitroller maintains a balance of Comp for distributing rewards.
  - Typically the Comp token address is hardcoded in the Comptroller, but if it needs to be deployed to a different address, we can use the `ComptrollerHarness` contracts defined at the bottom of `SimpleComptrollerV1.sol` and `SimpleComptrollerV2.sol`, which adds a new `compAddress` variable with getter/setter.
